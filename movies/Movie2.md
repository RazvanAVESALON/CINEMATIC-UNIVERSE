# A New Dawn

# Synopsis
After surviving the fight with Bardo the Redeemer, the curious kids manage to exit the cave but to their horror, outside night came. That could only mean that Bardo was even more powerful than before. It was of no help that all four of the kids just started their therapy sessions to get rid of their fear of the dark.</br>
The only chance for them was to go somewhere where natural light was powerful, even at night. As the Moon was a bit to far to reach, they ran to a lake where the Moon's light was reflecting in the water. As Bardo was trying to swim to catch the curious kids, fighting the moonlight, a bright light emerged from the water. It was Sheila, the magical spirit that used her powers to drive Bardo back to his prison. </br>
Despite this success, it was no time to rest, as Bardo the Redeemer would be back very soon...
